# Do Not Do — Clinique MANA

- Do not behave like a clinical EMR
- Do not store diagnoses, therapy notes, or session transcripts
- Do not assume internal appointment scheduling in early phases
- Do not duplicate GoRendezvous functionality
- Do not invent calendars or appointment execution logic
- Do not store Zoom meeting links or recordings
- Do not mix platform triage data with professional clinical notes
- Do not bypass RLS "temporarily"
- Do not rely on frontend-only permission checks
- Do not invent billing or payout logic beyond confirmed rules
- Do not rewrite applied migrations
- Do not silently fail errors
- Do not introduce libraries or abstractions without justification
- Do not assume future features are already in scope

The platform manages intake, matching, billing, and compensation.
Clinical care delivery remains with the professional.
